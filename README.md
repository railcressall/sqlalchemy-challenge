# sqlalchemy-challenge

you will find both the Jupyter Notebook and Flask API script in the surfs up folder within this repo. 

When running my Flask Script I had to use the absolute path when creating my engine to get it to attach to the Juypter Notebook. 

I have provided what should be the relative path. If you need me to update my code to reflect this for proper grading please let me know so I can work with my Instructor and TA to get this corrected. 

If you are unable to grade due to the absolute path, please also let me know so I can work with them to get this corrected. 

Relative path = engine = create_engine("sqlite:///Resources/hawaii.sqlite")

I am not sure why I could not get it to run on my local using this path.
